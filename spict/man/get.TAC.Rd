\usage{
get.TAC(
  rep,
  fractiles = list(catch = 0.5, bbmsy = 0.5, ffmsy = 0.5),
  breakpointB = 0,
  safeguardB = list(limitB = 0, prob = 0.95),
  catchIntermediateYear = NULL,
  CatchIntermediateYearSDFac = 1,
  getFit = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rep}{Result list from fit.spict().}

\item{catchIntermediateYear}{Catch during assessment year (corresponding to argument
\code{catch} in \code{\link{take.c}}), e.g. last year's TAC (default:
\code{NULL}; see details for more information).}

\item{getFit}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} the function returns the fitted
'spictcls' object with respective HCR (\code{FALSE} by default).}

\item{catchIntermediateYearSDFac}{Factor for the multiplication of the standard deveiation of the
catch during the assessment year (\code{stdevfacC}; default = 1; see
\code{\link{take.c}}).}
}
\value{
A list with the TAC and management relevant quantities; if
    \code{getFit} is \code{TRUE} the fitted object with the respective HCR is
    returned.

\details{
Dependent on the start of the management period (e.g. advice year), there
might be a time lag between the last observation and the start of the
management period. If this is the case, an assumption about the intermediate
time period (e.g. assessment year) has to be made. Either the fishing
mortality is extrapolated for the intermediate time period (\code{catchIntermediateYear
= NULL}; default), or the argument \code{catchIntermediateYear} can be used to set the
catch in that period. The argument \code{catchIntermediateYearSDFac} allows to adjust the standard
deviation of the catch in the intermediate time period.
